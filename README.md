# sql-challenge

The goal is build a SQL database from six CSV files and perform some queries to test the database design.

The project folders contain the following:

* **data**: The six CSV files used to build the tables in the SQL database.
* **doc**: A PNG of the database ERD, and a PDF of the database documentation.
* **sql**: Two SQL files - one to build the database (EmployeeDB-schema.sql), and one to run SELECT statements on the database (EmployeeDB-queries.sql). The queries were tested using a local PostgreSQL server.
* **jupyter**: A supplemental analysis using a Python Jupyter notebook to connect to the database, store query results in Pandas DataFrames, and plot the results using Matplotlib.
